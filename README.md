<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
Third year project, a chess app that aids in Chess training by generating explanations <br/>
You can analyse games + positions and play through mistakes detected using stockfish. <br/>
Spaced repetition helps store the mistakes that have been played into memory <br/>
Explanation generation comments on various positional and tactical factors <br/>
Text based on scoring and rulesets, both of which can be easily added (modular code) <br/>
A link to my report which outlines the development, outcome and evaluation of the app is below <br/>
